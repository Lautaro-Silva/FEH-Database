# Fire Emblem Heroes Database

A custom PostgreSQL database for Fire Emblem Heroes, focused on unique weapons, skills, and their effects, restrictions, and inheritance paths.

This project aims to:

- Provide a searchable structure for skills and weapons by their effects (for example, all skills that apply "Exposure", "Guard", etc.)

- Track inheritance rules and unit restrictions for each skill and weapon

- Include metadata for heroes, such as:

    - Weapon type

    - Movement type

    - Color

    - Hero variant (e.g. Legendary, Brave, Ascended)

    - Release date

The goal is to create a useful tool for the community, and a solid example of using relational databases for game data modeling.

Built With:

- PostgreSQL

- SQL

- Data sourced manually from Game8 and Fire Emblem Wiki
